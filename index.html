				<p>Oh, 95, always full, always congested.</p>
				<p>You stress me out.</p>
				<p>Although in the early morning you're not so bad,</p>
				<p>In the afternoon, you stink!</p>
				<p>5 o'clock, 6 o'clock, makes no difference. You really stink!</p>
				<p>7 o'clock, you're much better, but that's too late.</p>

				<h1>Express Lanes, You're Cool, But You Cost Too Much</h1>

				<p>Oh, 95... Wait. What are those two lanes on your far left?</p>
				<p>Cars are moving. Moving fast! Way faster than me!</p>
				<p>I must drive on thee!</p>
				<p>Oh, express lanes, in the morning you deprive me of $4.50. You stink!</p>
				<p>5 o'clock, $10.00?!!! 6 o'clock, $7.50?!!! You really stink!</p>
				<p>Express lanes, I can't afford you.</p>

				<p>Oh, express lanes... Wait. That bus moving fast on your asphalt, where is it going?</p>
				<p>I must find out. I must ride on it!</p>
				<p>95 Express bus to Miramar, you're my stress reliever.</p>
				<p>You take me to LaunchCode and bring me home, all in an hour!</p>
				<p>From your stop, I ride my bike only for five blocks!</p>
				<p>Oh, 95 Express bus, you make me as happy as a clam.</p>
